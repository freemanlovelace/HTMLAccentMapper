## Usage

This script utilizes HTML entities to enable QWERTY (or other keyboard types) to input accents. Instead of using the **`&`** character to initialize the entity, it uses the **`;`** character.

<b>Example</b>

**`;eacute;`** will produce the following output: **`Ã©`** .

Inserting a **`;`** character initializes a table (named key_tab in the script), and all subsequent characters will be added to the table. Inserting another **`;`** stops the gathering process and checks whether the content of key_tab is a valid HTML entity, replacing it with its corresponding accent.

If Space or Enter key is pressed, then key_tab is reinitialized.
